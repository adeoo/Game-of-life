# Game-of-life
The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Horton Conway.


## **About the Game**
GOL is a **zero-player** game that consists of a lattice with 'live' and 'dead' cells, where the congiguration of each generation is determined by the the coniguration of previous generations and a set of **four unchanging simple rules**.This means that **generation zero** is the only variable and  wil determine the fate of all cells in further generations. As a result Interesting patterns occur. you can read more about he game [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).


### **Game rules:**
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

## **About the Script**
This is a simple script that pops out a 600x600 window  with a lattice and a random generation zero, and proceeds to play the game, close the window to terminate the script.
